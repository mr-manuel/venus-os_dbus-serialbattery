        ## Thanks for helping us to improve the driver!

        In the case you have difficulties to write in english, try the [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com) translator.

        ## üö® IMPORTANT üö®

        * Please carefully read all the instructions below including the descriptions! Very often we have to request the data again, because it was not provided in the first place.

        * Please try the `nightly` build first, if you are not already using it. It's very likely that the bug is already fixed. See [here](https://mr-manuel.github.io/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery_docs/general/install#nightly-build) how to install it.

        * Did you reboot at least once after you saw the issue? If not, reboot and check if the issue still exists.

        * Please read the complete [changelog](https://github.com/mr-manuel/dbus-serialbattery/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

        * Make sure to provide the logfiles in the correct format with a HUMAN READABLE timestamp by piping the output through `tai64nlocal`. See [here](https://mr-manuel.github.io/venus-os_dbus-serialbattery_docs/troubleshoot/#driver-log-files) how to get the driver log files.

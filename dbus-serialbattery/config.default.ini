; --------- Cell Voltages ---------
; Description:
;     Calculates the minimum and maximum battery voltage based on the number of cells and their voltage.
;     ATTENTION: This does not prevent overcharging or overdischarging of individual cells.
;     To prevent overcharging and overdischarging, use these features (enabled by default):
;         - Charge Voltage Limitation (prevents overcharging)
;         - Cell Voltage Current Limitation (prevents both overcharging and overdischarging)
;
; Example:
;     16 cells * 3.45 V/cell = 55.2 V max charge voltage
;     16 cells * 2.90 V/cell = 46.4 V min discharge voltage
;
; Minimum voltage (can NOT be seen as cut-off voltage)
;     Used to:
;         - Ensures that the charge voltage limit (CVL) does not fall below the threshold if calculated dynamically
;         - Set SOC to 0%, if SOC_CALCULATION is enabled
MIN_CELL_VOLTAGE   = 2.900

; Maximum voltage (can be seen as bulk/absorption voltage)
; Used to;
;     - Set the maximum charge voltage limit (CVL).
;     - Set SOC to 100%, if SOC_CALCULATION is enabled
MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE   = 3.450

; Float voltage (can be seen as resting voltage)
; Used to:
;     - Set the maximum charging voltage (CVL) after the battery is fully charged
FLOAT_CELL_VOLTAGE = 3.375


; --------- SoC Reset Voltage (must match BMS settings) ---------
; +++ This section is independent and unrelated to the "SoC calculation" section below. +++
; This is used to reset the SoC to 100% periodically to correct SoC drift.
; Description:
;     Some BMS systems may need to reset the SoC to 100% periodically due to SoC drift.
;     For example, JKBMS resets its internal SoC value if it reaches the upper voltage level.
;     Using this method, the charging voltage can be raised regularly to achieve that.
;     (Other BMS systems like Daly need an active overwriting of the SoC parameter. This happens each time
;     when the charging mode changes from bulk/absorption to float and the cells are equalized. They do
;     not need this feature here.)
;     Specify the cell voltage at which the SoC should be reset to 100% by the BMS.
;       - JKBMS: SoC is reset to 100% if one cell reaches the Over Voltage Protection (OVP) voltage.
;     It is recommended to start with OVP voltage - 0.030 (see Example).
;       - Increase (add) by 0.005 in steps if the system does not switch to float mode, even if
;         the target voltage SOC_RESET_CELL_VOLTAGE * CELL_COUNT is reached.
;       - Decrease (lower) by 0.005 in steps if the system hits the OVP too fast, before all
;         cells could be balanced and the system goes into protection mode multiple times.
; Example:
;     If OVP is 3.650, then start with 3.620 and increase/decrease by 0.005.
; Note:
;     The value must be higher than the MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE.
;     You also have to set CELL_VOLTAGES_WHILE_CHARGING accordingly if you set CCCM_CV_ENABLE to true,
;     otherwise the charging current will be reduced to 0 before the target voltage is reached and the
;     battery will never switch to float.
SOC_RESET_CELL_VOLTAGE = 3.650
; Specify after how many days the SoC reset voltage should be reached again.
; The timer is reset when the SoC reset voltage is reached.
; Leave empty if you don't want to use the SoC reset feature.
; Example:
;     Value is set to 15
;     day 1: SoC reset reached once
;     day 16: SoC reset reached twice
;     day 31: SoC reset not reached since it's very cloudy
;     day 34: SoC reset reached since the sun came out
;     day 49: SoC reset reached again, since last time it took 3 days to reach SoC reset voltage

; --------- Charge Voltage Limitation (affecting CVL) ---------
; Description:
;     Limit the maximum charging voltage (MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE * cell count), switch from max voltage to float
;     voltage (FLOAT_CELL_VOLTAGE * cell count) and back.
;     False: Max charging voltage is always maintained.
;     True: Max charging voltage is reduced based on charge mode.
;         After max voltage is reached and cell voltage difference is smaller or equal to
;         SWITCH_TO_FLOAT_CELL_VOLTAGE_DIFF, it switches to float voltage after SWITCH_TO_FLOAT_WAIT_FOR_SEC

;         After cell voltage difference is greater or equal to SWITCH_TO_BULK_CELL_VOLTAGE_DIFF
;         OR
;         SoC is below SWITCH_TO_BULK_SOC_THRESHOLD,
;         it switches back to max voltage.
; Example when set to True:
;     The battery reaches a max voltage of 55.2 V and the max cell difference is 0.010 V, then switch to float
;     voltage of 53.6 V after 900 additional seconds to reduce stress on the batteries. Max voltage of
;     55.2 V is allowed again if the max cell difference exceeds 0.080 V or SoC drops below 80%.
; Enable charge voltage control management (True/False).
CVCM_ENABLE = True

;     the timer will restart if the cell voltage difference exceeds 0.013 V (0.010 + 0.003).
SWITCH_TO_FLOAT_CELL_VOLTAGE_DEVIATION = 0.003

; -- CVL switch to bulk/absorption
; WARNING: If SWITCH_TO_BULK_SOC_THRESHOLD and SWITCH_TO_BULK_CELL_VOLTAGE_DIFF are disabled, the battery will stay at the float
;     voltage until the driver/system is restarted.

; ---- Based on SoC ----
; Specify the SoC level where CVL is reset to max voltage (bulk/absorption).
; To disable, leave empty or set to 0.
SWITCH_TO_BULK_SOC_THRESHOLD = 80

; ---- Based on cell voltage difference ----
; Specify the cell voltage difference where CVL is reset to max voltage (bulk/absorption) if the value exceeds this threshold.
; As a guideline: Cells are considered imbalanced if the cell difference exceeds 5% of the nominal cell voltage.
; Example: 3.2 V * 5 / 100 = 0.160 V
; To disable, leave empty or set to 10.
SWITCH_TO_BULK_CELL_VOLTAGE_DIFF = 0.080


; --------- Cell Voltage Limitation (affecting CVL) ---------
; This function prevents overcharging of single cells in a poorly balanced battery, which could cause the BMS to switch off due to overvoltage.
;
; Example:
;     15 cells are at 3.4 V, 1 cell is at 3.6 V. The total battery voltage is 54.6 V, and the Victron System sees no reason to
;     lower the charging current as the control voltage (absorption voltage) is 55.2 V.
;     In this case, the cell voltage limitation kicks in and lowers the control voltage to keep it close to the MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE.
;
; In theory, this can also be done with CCL, but doing it with CVL has 2 advantages:
;     - In a well-balanced system, the current can be kept quite high until the end of charge by using MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE for charging.
;     - In systems with MPPTs and DC-feed-in activated, the Victron systems do not respect CCL, so CVL is the only way to prevent the
;       highest cell in a poorly balanced system from overcharging.
;
; There are different methods implemented to calculate CVL when a cell exceeds MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE:
;   1. P-Controller (penalty sum method)
;      The voltage overshoot of all cells that exceed MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE is summed up, and the control voltage is lowered by this "penalty sum".
;      This is calculated every CVL_RECALCULATION_EVERY seconds.
;   2. I-Controller
;      An I-Controller tries to control the voltage of the highest cell to MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE + SWITCH_TO_FLOAT_CELL_VOLTAGE_DIFF.
;      (for example, 3.45 V + 0.01 V = 3.46 V). If the voltage of the highest cell is above this level, CVL is reduced. If the voltage is below, CVL is
;      increased until cell count * MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE.
;      An I-Part of 0.2 V/Vs (CVL_ICONTROLLER_FACTOR) has proven to provide stable and fast control behavior.
;      This method is not as fast as the Penalty Sum Method but is usually smoother and more stable against toggling and has no stationary deviation.

; --------- Cell Voltage Current Limitation (affecting CCL/DCL) ---------

; --------- Voltage drop ---------
; If there is a voltage drop between the BMS and the charger due to wire size or length,
; you can specify the voltage drop here. The driver will then add the voltage drop
; to the calculated CVL to compensate.
; Example:
;     Cell count: 16
;     MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE = 3.45
;     Max voltage calculated = 16 * 3.45 = 55.20 V
;     CVL is set to 55.20 V, and the battery is charged until the charger reaches 55.20 V.
;     The BMS measures 55.05 V due to a voltage drop of 0.15 V on the cable.
;     Since the dbus-serialbattery reads 55.05 V from the BMS, the max voltage of 55.20 V is never reached,
;     and max voltage is maintained indefinitely.
;     By setting the VOLTAGE_DROP to 0.15 V, the voltage on the charger is increased, and the
;     target voltage on the BMS is reached. In this case CVL is set to 55.35 V.
